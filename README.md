Skylanders Collection Project

It allows users to keep a log of all the base Skylanders,  their in-game variants and magic items from Skylanders Spyros Adventure.
An example account can be used if you do not wish to create your own account, the details are here:

This project was designed and built to grow my laravel abilities and learn skills for future projects.
The frontend was built using Blade and styled with Tailwind.
Admin users are also implemented on this project allowing for the addition of additional collectables, however this is disabled for all normal users.
